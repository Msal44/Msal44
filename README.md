### My name is Melvyn Salvatierra and I have recently earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Sciemce with an emphasis in Enterprise Software. In high school I became interested with technologies such blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, etc. This led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science where I chose to specialize in Enterprise Software because I want to be this bridge that connects technology and businesses. Most importantly I want to be a bridge that connects and delivers technology to the people.

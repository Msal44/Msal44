### Hi!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Melvyn Salvatierra, I am a creative problem solver who enjoys working with others. To continue my higher education, I am attending Northern Illinois University to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with an emphasis in Enterprise Software. I am a coder on a mission to empower the world and always in search of new problems to solve. I am currently in my Junior year of University in search of an internship, in Master the Mainframe by IBM 2020 competition, and volunteering my skills to help orgonizations during this tough time.
